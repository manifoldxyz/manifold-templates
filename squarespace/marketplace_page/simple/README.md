# Simple Squarespace Marketplace Site

<img src="./images/screenshot.png" width="500" />

This is a simple example of a Marketplace Listing Page

## How does it work?
In this example, we are adding a [Connect Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/connect-widget) and a [Marketplace Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/marketplace-widgets) which will display a marketplace listing.

## Prerequisites
1. Create a Site on Squarespace.

## Steps
### Install Widgets
1. Go to site editor and click Settings => Advanced => Code Injection

2. Copy and paste the following into the **Header** code snippet box:
```
<!-- connect widget -->
<script async src="https://connect.manifoldxyz.dev/2.2.4/connect.umd.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://connect.manifoldxyz.dev/2.2.4/connect.css" />
<!-- marketplace widget -->
<script async src="https://marketplace.manifoldxyz.dev/3.3.7/marketplace.umd.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://marketplace.manifoldxyz.dev/3.3.7/marketplace.css" />
```

  data-client-id="<yourClientId>"
  data-network="<1 for Mainnet or 5 for Goerli>"
></div>
```

### Add the Marketplace-Widget

**Copy and paste the following into the box** (make sure to replace the variables with your own values): 

```
<div
  data-widget="m-layout-complete-listing"
  data-id="<yourListingId>"
  data-network="<1 for Mainnet or 5 for Goerli>"
></div>
```
