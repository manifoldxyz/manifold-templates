# NFT Profile Page

<img src="screenshot.png" width="300" />

This is a simple example of an NFT Profile Page. It contains a way for someone to connect their wallet and view their NFTs.

## Configuration
Please make sure you set the NETWORK, YOUR_APP_NAME and YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID in the index.html file.

## How does it work?
In this example, we are adding a [Connect Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/connect-widget), which will allow a user to authenticate to your website.  Once authenticated, your app will have access to a [Data Client](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/connect-widget/data-client), which allows you to retrieve information about the user's NFTs.
